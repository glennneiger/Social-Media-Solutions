<p style="text-align: justify;">SEO can be broken down into two major categories ‚Äì On Page which¬†refers to the optimization done ON¬†your webpages, and Off Page which refers to the tactics that you employ OFF¬†of your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have already taken an in-depth look at the¬†<a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/on-page-seo-techniques">6 On Page SEO Techniques That Will Increase Your Rankings</a>, and in this blog post, we will focus on Off Page SEO.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is SEO?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SEO, or search engine optimization, is a combination of methodologies, tactics, and strategies that position¬†your website¬†on¬†a higher placement for¬†search engine results page (SERP) for platforms¬†like Google, and Bing. SEO directly contributes to how visible your website, blog posts, and other content is on the web.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Benefits of Good SEO</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Utilizing proper SEO techniques will result in a direct increase of website traffic which brings about numerous advantages.¬†Here are the 3 most beneficial:</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Increased brand awareness</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By positioning yourself higher in search engine rankings, the amount of people interacting with your brand increases and they associate your brand with the keywords that they were searching for. This helps to instill trust in your brand and positions yourself as an authoritative in your field.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. It's cost effective</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generating in-bound leads through SEO is much more cost efficient over traditional out-bound lead generating. How much more efficient? According to a recent study by Hubspot.com, in-bound leads now cost 61% less than out-bound leads.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Increased site usability</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only does good SEO increase the ability¬†for search engine bots to crawl and properly index your page, it creates a site architecture that is easily navigable by website visitors which reduces the number of people that ‚Äúbounce‚Äù out of your website due to bad usability.</p>

<h2><strong>Off Page SEO Techniques</strong></h2>
<a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Top-3-Off-Page-SEO-Techniques-That-Will-Boost-Your-Online-Presence.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-12002 size-full" src="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Top-3-Off-Page-SEO-Techniques-That-Will-Boost-Your-Online-Presence.jpg" alt="" width="845" height="422" /></a>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Search engines like Google care about how your content is interacted with away from your website. For example, if you have a bunch of high-quality websites linking back to your site, then obviously you¬†are providing quality content that people like engaging with.¬†The same goes for if your content is spreading like wildfire on social media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there are an abundance of off-page SEO tactics and techniques that you can incorporate into your marketing strategy, it‚Äôs best to focus on the strategies that have the biggest impact to avoid¬†stretching your resources¬†too far. Never forget that being awesome in a couple of areas is much better than being mediocre across many.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Social Media</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One factor that contributes to good Off Page SEO is how many back-links your website receives ‚Äì something that we will touch on later in this post; however, this was manipulated by shady marketers employing ‚Äúblack hat‚Äù SEO techniques in the past, and it quickly diluted the entire SERP process. In response to this, not only has Google penalized these types of offenders, but they have also shifted so much focus away from back links, and placed it on social signals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now search engines look at factors like the number of Facebook likes, retweets, Google +1s, and more. This makes social media more important than ever. Let‚Äôs not forget that Google also loves Google+ and they have¬†stated that not only does your content on Google+ get indexed faster, it also has a direct effect on your search engine rankings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another great benefit of social shares is the content that it influences in search results. Social profiles are often placed in the top search results for brand names. If you search for the keyword ‚ÄúMOZ‚Äù in Google, you can see that social profiles show up in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th search result, only being overtaken in the third position by Wikipedia. MOZ has absolutely dominated the entire first page of search results for their brand, and you can accomplish this too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let‚Äôs also not forget that social media channels are search engines too. More and more people are veering away from traditional search engines like Google and turning to Facebook and Twitter for information.¬†This gives you an additional platform in which you can drive quality traffic to your website.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Social Bookmarking</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some may argue that social bookmarking is dead, but I have to disagree. If used properly across the right sites, posting content on social bookmarking sites can increase the number of the social signals¬†that are being attributed to your brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are hundreds of social bookmarking sites out there, and depending on your industry, there may only be a small handful of them that will benefit you.¬†The best social bookmarking sites in¬†2016 are Reddit and Digg.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reddit</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of 2016, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors and ranked the 25th most popular website in the world. It contains a community of registered members that can submit content such as text posts or even direct links. These submissions are then voted upon by members and can be brought to not only the front page, but to the top of category called subreddits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gaining traction in Reddit does take time and it isn‚Äôt something that you can put half-hearted effort into, but if used properly for your industry keywords; it can be a powerful tool for driving traffic to your site and building quality back links.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Digg</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Launching in July of 2013, Digg is a news¬†platform that aggregates syndicated web content into a curated front page¬†and was once one of the biggest social voting sites on the web. Although it has lost some of its luster due to its biggest competitor, Reddit, it still receives over 2.5 million visitors a month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like Reddit, users vote on the content submitted (upvotes are called Diggs) and if you are able to get to the homepage of the website, you are guaranteed to skyrocket the amount of traffic to your site ‚Äì at least for a short period of time.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Link Building</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I had said that Google has shifted some of its focus away from back links and towards social signals, don't underestimate the power of quality link building. In fact, if implemented correctly, link building can be the absolute most <a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/search-engine-optimization/">beneficial Off Page SEO technique</a> available¬†in 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I could write an entire book about the numerous link building strategies, both good and bad that you could follow, but for the sake of keeping this blog post from becoming a novel, I will just touch on the basics.</p>

<h4><strong>Link Quality</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important aspect of links pointing to your site is quality. Google and Bing care very little¬†if you have 100¬†websites pointing to your website if they are spammy, low-quality sources.¬†So what is a quality link? A link¬†coming from a big, quality website that has established itself as an authoritative in your field is considered to be very good choice.</p>

<h4><strong>Follow vs No Follow Links</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two types of links ‚Äì follow and no follow. Although they¬†both act as a reference to a URL and they both can be a source of driving traffic, a no follow link has¬†a modified HTML tag attached to it that tells search engine bots that the site that they are pointing too should not be trusted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examples of common no follow links would be forums¬†and¬†blog comment sections. No follow links are a clear indication that you should be focusing on building quality links, and not just try to spam quality websites.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Building Quality Links</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building anything but quality links is a waste of time. Period. It doesn‚Äôt help your page rank in any way, it makes your brand look spammy, and it will hurt you in the long run. Here are 3 ways that you can build quality links that will directly impact your SERPs in a positive way.</p>
<strong>Guest Blogging</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This link building technique not only allows you to land quality back links from quality sites, it establishes you as an authoritative in your field, and it drives traffic back to your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are plenty of websites that allow guest blogging and the best way to find them is through a simple Google search ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù + ‚Äúwrite for us‚Äù. This will pull up a list of possible places that you can submit content. Although, that is the easy part of the process; many sites will require that your content passes specific requirements to be posted and they might even charge you to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guest blogging is a bit more intensive than other methods, but it can lead to the most beneficial results.</p>
<strong>Press Releases¬†</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot like guest blogging, writing press releases is a way to take your content and share it on an authoritative site to build quality links; however, the content written for submission is not a blog post written around about specific industry keywords, but content that highlights milestones for your company, shares breaking news from your organization, or announces general information to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although press releases do provide SEO benefits, over the past few years, this importance has been slowly declining and it is advised that you also focus on other link building techniques in your overall Off Page SEO strategy.</p>
<strong>Broken Link Building </strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might not seem like it, but the internet has already been around for 25 years. And over the years, it has become very broken. On a daily basis, websites go down, blog articles disappear, and URLS change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of this, there is a huge opportunity to replace broken links with your own content. The process is quite simple. When you find a broken link, you contact the owner of the site to let them know and you offer them an appropriate replacement link in the process. The owner of the site just might repay your kindness of finding the broken link by using your link to replace his old one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A great tool to find broken links on a large scale is¬†<strong>Xenu‚Äôs Link Sleuth¬†</strong>which allows you to search hundreds of URLs at once. The best way to get started is by building a list of URLs from authoritative sites in your industry, and let the tool go to work.</p>

<h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SEO is an investment. It takes understanding, time, and patience to properly implement a strategy that will increase your search engine rankings for specific keywords in your industry; however, by combining quality On Page and Off Page SEO techniques into your marketing strategy, you are guaranteed to see amazing results in the long run.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:66:"Top 3 Off Page SEO Techniques That Will Boost Your Online Presence";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:351:"SEO can be broken down into two major categories - On Page which refers to the optimization done ON your webpages, and Off Page which refers to the tactics that you employ OFF of your website.

<p style="text-align: justify;">An average of 80% of small businesses fail within the first year due to lack of revenue. As the old saying goes ‚Äì It takes money to make money; and this leaves many small business owners scratching their head trying to find affordable ways to promote their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, there‚Äôs no need for the confusion. There are several techniques that can help you boost sales for your small business, all without breaking the bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, we have compiled the top 7 ways that your business can generate the revenue that it needs not only to survive, but flourish.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Boost Sales for Your Small Business</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Build customer relationships</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I‚Äôm amazed by the number of small businesses that fail to properly address customer relations. Loyal customers will always be your best sales people because they will steadily supply you with referrals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to maintain consistent communication with your customers so that your brand stays imbedded in their mind and this can be done through simple email marketing techniques such as sending out a monthly newsletter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember to provide your customers with the same value that you would expect form a company that you have made a purchase with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is always better to go above and beyond when it comes to delivering value to your customers because if you aren‚Äôt doing it properly, someone else will.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Customer loyalty programs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another great tactic is setting up a customer loyalty program that rewards customers who frequently make purchases from your company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examples of a great customer loyalty program might give customers free merchandise, coupons, and other rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most popular options is to use a simple point system; however, this will only work for certain industries such as a business that encourages frequent, small purchases like coffeehouses and car washes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Public relations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Online marketing has dominated conventional advertising, but there are still numerous ‚Äúoffline‚Äù ways that you can build awareness and increase sales for your small business using creative public relations techniques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way is by hosting a small charity event such as a food drive. Not only will you be providing the community with a good service, you will also be increasing brand awareness for your company. It‚Äôs a win-win situation for everybody.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">4. Limited time promotion</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Running a promotion for discounted products or services is a great way to increase demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several ways to run a successful promotion, but three tactics have proven to be the most effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bundle pricing</strong> ‚Äì bundling items together is a great way to attain a higher perceived value for your products and services. Running a ‚Äúbuy one, get one free‚Äù promotion will make your customers feel like they are getting more value than what they are actually paying for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Markdowns</strong> ‚Äì This is the basic process of lowering your prices on certain products for a limited time. It‚Äôs a great way to generate a sense of urgency for customers and results in a short-term boost of sales for your small business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loss Leaders</strong> ‚Äì A great way to clear out old or overstocked items is by offering them at a very steep discount. This type of promotion might only have you break even on the items, or run at a slight loss, but it is a great way to increase traffic to your store.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">5. Upsell current customers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.bain.com/Images/Value_online_customer_loyalty_you_capture.pdf">According to global management consulting firm, Bain and Co.</a>, on average, repeat customers spend 67 percent more than new customers. Giving these statistics, it only makes sense to provide your customers opportunities to buy additional products from you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers are also up to 70% more likely to buy additional products from a brand that they have a good experience with in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When trying to upsell a product, make sure what you are trying to promote is relevant to the product that your customer has already purchased and don‚Äôt try to upsell your customer until they have already finished their original transaction. You don‚Äôt want to risk losing the first sale by acting greedy.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6. Optimize for local search</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you run a brick-and-mortar operation, increasing foot traffic and brand awareness for your location is vital for success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a> is a free tool that allows you to share the most essential information about your business across Google Maps and Google‚Äôs search engine results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By verifying your physical address with Google, you are able to add pictures, respond to reviews, and share what‚Äôs best about your business.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">7. Use Social Media</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although all of these ways to increase sales have proven to be highly effective, the tactic that can produce the best results by far is using social media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are millions of users on social media that are logging in everyday and performing countless searches for information about companies‚Äô products and services. This provides unlimited potential for getting your company in front of the right people at the right time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don‚Äôt forget that social media is completely free to use, with no restrictions on how much you can post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social media also gives you a platform in which you are able to build a following of loyal customers that have the ability to communicate directly with your brand. Consumers are much more likely to buy from your company if they can reach out to you with questions and receive timely responses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your business can also <a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/pay-per-click-advertising/">use social media for targeted advertising</a> based upon your customer‚Äôs demographics and interest which will help you quickly spread your brand‚Äôs reach to a whole new audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, there are countless ways to generate more sales for your small business while on a tight budget. Running a 50% off promotion, advertising a cleaver campaign on Facebook, or holding the right PR event can give your business the momentum that it needs to succeed.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:66:"7 Affordable Ways That You Can Boost Sales for Your Small Business";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:268:"An average of 80% of small businesses fail within the first year due to lack of revenue.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The truth is, to have a successful small business, it‚Äôs not enough to deliver great products and services to the market. You must continually deal with fierce competition, changes in the economy, and shortages of revenue, all while trying to build up your customer base.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, there‚Äôs no need to stress about trying to attract¬†new customers. In this article, we will discuss 10 proven ways that small businesses owners, just like you, overcame this very problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to acquire new clients</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Get to know your customers</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every business, regardless of size, should identify their ideal customer so they can properly market their goods to the right people, at the right time, in the right way. This approach will help you reduce wasted resources by narrowing your focus to where it counts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/everything-marketers-need-to-research-create-detailed-buyer-personas-template.aspx#sm.00018q0qxt20gfljuno2phxzej5ed">According to Hubspot.com</a>, you should be tailoring your content, messaging, product development, and services to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different groups. These groups are referred to as your ‚Äúbuyer personas‚Äù.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create your own buyer personas, identify key characteristic about your customers such as their gender, age, education, marital status, hobbies, employment, and where they search for new information about products and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have gathered this data, start to identify key characteristics or behaviors among your customers and define who they truly are.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Expand your network</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most startups tap into their personal networks to generate their first sales, but many owners find that they quickly run out of new leads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent this from happening, focus on building your personal network, both online and off.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offline networking </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of attending conferences or meet-ups where all your competitors are lurking, trying going to the same watering holes as your customers and make some real face-to-face connections.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Online networking</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Utilizing social media is a great way to expand your online network. There are hundreds, if not thousands of <a href="https://groups.fb.com/">Facebook groups</a> filled with people in your target market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Join a group that addresses the same issues your customers are facing; and provide them with free, professional advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But remember, do not over promote your brand. Instead, focus on helping them solve their problems and follow up with them on a later date with exclusive offers from your business.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Deliver Exceptional Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of just trying to pitch new clients, make sure that you first add value and build a relationship between you before trying to close a deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johneturner1/">John Turner, CEO of¬†UsersThink, says</a> ‚Äú<em>After I find a company or organization that might be a good fit, I do a very quick analysis of their site, find one major issue with real consequences that I know could be fixed quickly, and contact someone at that organization telling them not only the problem, but how to fix it. It takes much longer than a regular cold email, but it results in more serious attention being paid to an otherwise unknown person (me), and has led to many new clients.</em></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Have a SEO-Friendly Website</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best kind of website traffic is organic - visitors that come from an unpaid search result. Not only are they free, but they are generally higher quality leads and they have better conversion rates than paid visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you drive more organic traffic to your site? The short answer is through <a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/on-page-seo-techniques/">search engine optimization</a> (SEO).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding keywords to your webpages that potential customers are searching for using ‚ÄúGoogle-friendly‚Äù tactics will increase the number visitors to your website, and in turn, will result in more customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are numerous SEO analysis tools on the market like <a href="https://moz.com/products/pro">Moz Pro</a> that will help you analyze your current site, and make suggestion on how to improve your overall rankings.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Have an Impressive Business Card</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make a great first impression by presenting an impressive business card at your next meeting. If you don‚Äôt have the skills to make one yourself, there are several websites where you can <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">hire a freelancer</a> to design one for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always bring your business cards whenever you leave the house because you never know when you‚Äôll meet a prospective client. ¬†¬†<strong>¬†</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Invest in Advertising</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a SEO friendly website drives organic traffic, but SEO takes a lot of time and patience. That is why many business owners prefer to add advertising into their marketing mix.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pay Per Click advertising, or ‚ÄúPPC‚Äù for short, allows you to deliver laser-targeted advertising campaigns directly to your target market. You can build audiences based on information like age, gender, location, interests, hobbies, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Facebook and Google AdWords have made it easy to create and promote an ad, even with no prior experience, by providing default campaign settings; however, you won‚Äôt get the same results as hiring an experienced agency to set it up for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of what you choose, when executed properly, PPC advertising can make a huge impact on attracting new customers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Use Email Marketing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/email-marketing/">Email marketing</a> has been around since the 90‚Äôs, and it still proves to be a highly successful way of reaching out to potential customers and driving sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to email - keep it simple. Send a monthly newsletter that features company news, shares your latest blog posts, or reveals a big promotion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don‚Äôt have an email list? Start building one by offering exclusive content, like an eBook, as a downloadable resource on your website.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. Don‚Äôt Forget to Follow Up</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Filling your sales pipeline takes work and you will lose leads as they work down the funnel. This makes it vital to always chase them down and try to close the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Josh Sprague, the CEO of Orange Mud suggests - <em>‚ÄúRemember to set follow up tasks (follow up to sample sent, etc.), and execute your plan. So many leads and great conversations are wasted because you forget to follow up.‚Äù </em></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. Prioritize Your Referrals</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your referrals are prime opportunities, not just leads. When a lead is referred by a customer that had a positive interaction with your brand, the chances of them also becoming a customer is much higher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take time to build a relationship with your referrals, whether it be adding a few extra lines of text to an email reply, or spending a few extra minutes on the phone with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always put in extra effort to make a referral feel special. They will not only be positioned to become a new client, but also a promoter of your brand, driving more referrals in the process.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10. Stop Needing New Customers</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I said it ‚Äì stop being so needy. Customer can sense desperation, and if they feel you are saying whatever it takes to make a sale, they won‚Äôt buy from you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don‚Äôt use cheap sales talk like ‚Äúhurry up, before it‚Äôs too late‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss this chance of a lifetime‚Äù. These cheesy one-liners will make you look more like an amateur salesperson, not a business professional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focus on helping your customers solve their pain points, and not always closing a deal. You might lose out on a few opportunities, but make up for brand.</p>

This means you should be more tactical when managing your digital existence. Fortunately, this is not too difficult. If you want to get your business noticed without spending too much money; you should follow the five strategies below:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--><strong>1. Social Media is a Great Medium, But Use It Wisely</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, most firms are connected with clients on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn as well as through other social media channels. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are doing it right. A firm that never stops marketing its products on social networks can lose its followers. Do not use every post or tweet to advertise your service or product. Instead, you should mix the links to your products with exciting stories that are pertinent to your business and target audience, as well as some private posts, like a fun story about your office ethos, to get your business noticed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not overdo it though. Even though frolicking kitten photographs rule the web, they don‚Äôt really belong on the social accounts of your business, even if you are running a grocery store.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Avoid Buying Backlinks</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Link backs to your site from other websites are said to be the leading rank-influencing issue in Search Engine Optimization (SEO). If the search is an enormous driver of traffic towards your website, it might be tempting to buy backlinks from suits that use this dark art, so be careful because this is risky.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google efficiently views every link to a website as an assurance vote that pushes your ranking up and it equates any purchased backlinks as vote rigging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its place, focus on constructing relationships with trustworthy websites to get your business noticed. You might search for an opportunity to syndicate some content on other sites or see if you can add value to their website. Another option could be to look at searching websites using Google that has pointed out your firm in any post and want a backlink to your site.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Testing With Instagram</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although most industries have a lively presence on Twitter and Facebook, they ignore Instagram and other platforms. This is wrong. There are more than 300 million web surfers who regularly spend 20-25 minutes daily on Instagram; which could prove to be a powerhouse for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are running a B2B business, you might consider that Instagram‚Äôs image-based stage just applies to florists, bakeries and other professions with photogenic-based products. Instagram, however, can connect you with present or potential clients, regardless of your business niche. It can furthermore serve as an employment tool, permitting your business to display its firm culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hootsuite‚Äôs Instagram (Social media managing system) account is an example of this way to get your business noticed. Through 13,300 plus followers and counting; their account displays scenes from Hootsuite‚Äôs dog-friendly workplace. In the same way, email-marketing MailChimp‚Äôs account is run well. With more than 19,000 followers, MailChimp features memorable images alongside a person wearing robot clothing and the firm logo replicated in latte material.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Emphasis on Securing Domain Names Which Match Your Business</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an extensive acceptance that Google punishes new domain additions like .nyc, .flowers, .house, .market, as well as the numerous additional novel top domains (gTLDs) in ranking their search position. In fact, numerous people think that Google does not support domains registered through these newly introduced extensions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚Äú<a href="https://www.hover.com/blog/do-new-top-level-domains-affect-seo/">Generally, our schemes include new gTLDs as well as other gTLDs, like .com or .org</a>,‚Äù Google‚Äôs John Mueller clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So there is no need for a big money outlay to get your matching domain name on .com, in place of a novel domain extension, since Google will never reward you for this.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Build Your Company Website Cleverly</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the diversity of reasonable website creators at your personal disposal, it is better to tackle matters through a professional service. <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> would help you develop and run a show stopping site for only $18 with a business account; whereas a pro account through Weebly will cost you just $12 monthly. WIX offers a free version, bare-bones, in addition to their paid plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.web.com/">Web.com</a> and <a href="https://ph.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, as well as other domain shops, sell domain registrations through their own webpage designing plus hosting. They, furthermore, provide cost effective services that offer virtual storefronts plus email communication to get your business noticed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As your promotion budget grows, you will have more choices to make, such as opting for a mobile-optimized feature in your website¬†and paid promotion services to add on. However, if you are able to make a solid basis; using these techniques to make content as well as a web site that resonates with your clients in the initial stages, you‚Äôll have substantial advantages over your competitors.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:59:"Top 5 Techniques That Will Get Your Business Noticed Online";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:353:"If you are a small business you probably don‚Äôt have enough funds to draw clients to your website with costly digital ads.

Besides simply creating leads, social media ensures that businesses remain connected to their customers and helps nourish long term relationships. When beginning to formulate both social media marketing and a promotional campaign, there are two vital paths that a business can use, especially when trying to outsource a social media development partner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, appoint a specialized agency who will tackle the marketing campaign. Secondly, organize an in-house campaign, with the company using their own employees to fulfill all the responsibilities.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Media Agency: Advantages</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Pros.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11952" src="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Pros.jpg" alt="" width="818" height="218" /></a></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coming Up Through Campaigns</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agency will work with you to devise a suitable social media marketing campaign that will aid in pushing your business ahead. This promotional campaign would include: thinking up a promotional subject, deciding which social media platform would be the most appropriate for the campaign, drawing up a campaign budget and creating the appropriate advertisements for the campaign.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital marketers are knowledgeable in this sphere and keep their expertise up to date through the latest technology. They are skilled at devising a campaign that will keep you ahead of your competitors.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Market Investigation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a business owner you may not have the time or the skills to undertake the market investigation yourself. Social media marketing organizations have the correct tools plus skills to do the research and aid you in accessing your target market.¬† The organization will also assist you in targeting the correct demographic market and devise the best advertising approach that will be appealing to your target clientele.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Branding</strong></h3>

The agency will also help you in driving your brand, as well as placing it in front of your target clientele.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Economical</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you hire a professional organization you tend to save both time and money. Since you do not have the experience to undertake the social media marketing tasks, you would have a vertical learning curve which will take you a long time to master. This is not the case when you appoint an organization to assist you. The agency would complete the project in a short time and you will reap the rewards quickly.¬† Digital marketers are cost effective when you hire them to do the work on your behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wide knowledge along with the experience that professional organizations bring to your doorstep is their main advantage. The agency staff sleep, breathe and eat social networks. Moreover, they have a wide experience gained from working with many industries and trades. These agencies have extensive knowledge of the platform from which your business would derive maximum benefit. In addition, they also understand the perfect approach for implementing your promotion.</p>

<h2><strong>Social Media Agency: Disadvantages</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When examining the disadvantages of hiring an agency, one of the most obvious is the immediate costs associated with hiring that agency. Although pricing will vary, it is not stress-free to accept the costs of hiring an outside party. The revenue made from the increase in sales, should exceed the long term costs of an agency. But, the preliminary cost can be a barrier toward entry for many firms with a limited social media marketing budget.¬† This is mainly true for smaller firms and startups that have yet to build real momentum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, you might find yourself facing a loss if you and your agency part ways. If your business is totally reliant on a partner, and never learns the basics of campaign management, it can mean a challenging time downstream.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since they are an external party, a social media agency could create an objective valuation of the business, as well as implement an approach that provides you with the best gamble at success. They can bring about rapid results, as they are experienced and know what can work and what your company should avoid. Because of the curve related to social media marketing<strong>,</strong> using a professional agency would ensure the prevention of usual newbie errors. Instead of wasting time testing many possible avenues, a specialized and customized plan could be placed into action immediately so you could get faster results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As your promotion progresses, you can use an analytic as well as other certified mechanisms to optimize numerous features of the marketing campaign. They are competent enough and use various software such as: <a href="http://sproutsocial.com/">SproutSocial</a>, <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a> and <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a> to observe the action on each social network channel. Key skillset of your partner agency will assist you in extracting abundant information over time that, when correctly interpreted, will lead to more followers, additional shares, and eventually increased sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When signing with a social media marketing agency, you should be very cautious and ensure that you appoint an expert professional. Before signing any contract, you must do your research plus check references by contacting other business owners who have worked with the particular agency that you are planning on working with.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:68:"Social Media Marketing: Should You Do It Yourself or Hire an Agency?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:497:"Having visibility on all popular social media platforms is an absolute necessity, and not a treat for businesses and trades in most industries.

<h2>The Pros</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Pros.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-11952 size-full" src="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Pros.jpg" alt="Pro Outsourcing Social Media Marketing" width="818" height="218" /></a></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Getting Up To Speed with Variations in the Social Media Domain</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/4-parts-of-social-media-that-are-constantly-evolving-and-how-to-adapt/">sphere of social media is constantly changing</a> on a daily basis, and it is actually difficult for small to medium-sized firms to keep up-to-date with these changes. An agency which offers to provide these services would definitely have to keep themselves knowledgeable of these changes and revisions and notifying customers of any adjustments to services if it affects their channels or websites. A big company though, will more than likely have the funds to hire dedicated personnel for social media marketing; who would dedicate a percentage of their time in keeping up to date with the constant changes taking place.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Saving Time</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no doubt that being dynamic on social media is time intensive and in all businesses, time is valuable. A social media marketer would be quicker at writing posts, creating content, finding content, and knowing how to write content suitable for each of the diverse social media channels. Time is money, so the small to medium-size firms need to examine which option is the most cost-effective ‚Äì hiring a social media specialist or doing the work themselves.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Writing Skills</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not everybody knows what to write and how to write. Some people find it hard but others can find it easy to compose a lot of bright ideas naturally. One of my customers was tremendously good at writing. However, she was not able to recognize the capabilities of social media. So, after some coaching; she was able to use her Facebook page more effectively. Most of my clients state this as their foremost reason for outsourcing social media.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Do Whatever You Do Best</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I usually delegate my content writing to my team. Even if I can do it, I know it‚Äôs not really my forte. Therefore, it makes sense that I do more of what I do best and pay others to do whatever they do best. With this in mind, I have constructed a small team of specialists within my business that I can call on for guidance when required.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Knowledge</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are considering handing over your social media work to the specialists, who have lots of experience plus a ton of tricks and know-how to pull from their resources; take the time to look over their portfolio and their own social media actions before making any decisions to use them.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Apparatuses</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might not be able to distinguish all of the extensive tools that are out there which could help you with your social media management. The specialists do, and they typically already have loads of experience in using these tools to your advantage.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Expert Measurement</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social media experts know how to distinguish, study, and measure the consequences connected to social media data, as well as how to respond, based on that data.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Planned Thinking</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Professionals are well-prepared as they have lots of experience in creating a social media plan. They know what to do, as well as how to grow a social media platform that would work to satisfy the goals of your firm.</p>

<h2>The Cons</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cons-Outsourcing-Social-Media-Marketing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11953" src="http://www.socialmedia-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cons-Outsourcing-Social-Media-Marketing.jpg" alt="Cons Outsourcing Social Media Marketing" width="818" height="218" /></a></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Personal Touch Could Be Missing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though a marketer could build your trade personality in how they write your posts, the personal touch could be missing. Only a small quantity of posts need to be about your trade since social media is about sharing. The best practice is, if you do select outsourcing social media; is to either add an occasional personal post to a member or staff, or send the info to your marketer.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Time</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not an expert, it is much more time-consuming to handle your social media platform development yourself. This is because you might not be as effective and familiar as those who do it on a daily or regular basis. This is another reason for outsourcing social media<strong>.</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Unique Knowledge of Your Trade Is Not Visibly Manifested</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one knows your business as well as you do. Even if there are agents who specialize in niche markets, and who have a pretty decent idea of what your business is about; as well as your client base, no one knows your market as much as you do. So, if you will choose outsourcing social media, make certain you select an agency that recognizes and has worked with your type of business or trade, and who accepts your fundamental input.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Final Words</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some firms, the decision to use outsourcing social media is a stress-free one; it is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffcornwall/2016/02/20/a-cost-effective-approach-to-outsourcing-digital-marketing/#3a8caf2c43b2">cost- effective</a> and the directors or managers see the benefits/profits of a good social media following. For smaller firms, it is continually difficult to part with the pennies. However, in my experience; keeping it in-house will still utilize more costs, for example in training personnel, software development plus time ‚Äì these are essential if you want to use social media with a planned approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I¬†personally believe that the pros overshadow the cons, and it is better for you to trust social media experts to do this for you. If you do not feel confident about using these experts, then perhaps, you should consider investing in and building your own social media group composed of professionals.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:55:"The Pros and Cons of Outsourcing Social Media Marketing";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:284:"As a social media marketer, who offers services for firms who need aid with their social media marketing, it would be astute to assume that I am pro-outsourcing social media promotion.
